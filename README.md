<h2 align='left'>📋 About</h2>
<p align='left'>With the growing demand of deep-learning enterprises, it's really important to increase the speed at which these products are ideated, tested and shipped. To speed up this chain of processes, we come up with a one-stop solution, NeuralNetworkBuilder.</p>
<p align='left'>NeuralNetworkBuilder, allows a user to efficiently create a deep-learning architecture, with a few clicks and taps, and then enables them to train their Neural Network, with real-time display of how the model is learning over their training data. Training Data ? Yes, the user can also upload their own datasets, do Exploratory Data Analysis over their dataset, and use the cleaned and preprocessed data for their model.</p>
